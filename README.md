- 👋 Hi, I’m @Boel-T , or you can call me Thomas.
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things that could use some coding and smart funtionalities. Subjects range from Philisophy of science, over making coding and scientific knowledge accesible in general, to self-govenering vertical agriculture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science and machine learning at Integrify Academy (online). But I believe I will never stop learning before the day I will no longer be around.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I would really like to work on setting up setting up Natural Language Processeing to evaluate and condense scientific findings and arguments into small nuggets on cendenced knowledge, accessible to anyone in a big database.
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can get in touch with me on thomasmboel@gmail.com
